      "strDescriptionEN": "The Copa Argentina (English: Argentine Cup), officially known as the \"Copa Total Argentina\" due to sponsorship reasons, is an official football cup competition organized by the Argentine Football Association (AFA), with the aim of qualifying one club to the Copa Libertadores.\r\n\r\nThe first editions of the championship were contested by teams playing in Primera División that did not earn eligibility to participate in the Copa Libertadores of the following year, and the best placed clubs playing in regional leagues.\r\n\r\nThe tournament was re-launched in 2011, with teams of all divisions that form the Argentine football league system taking part of the championship. The winner of Copa Argentina qualifies for the Supercopa Argentina against the reigning champions of Primera División.\r\n\r\nBoca Juniors is the most successful team with three titles won, (1969, 2012 and 2015).\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nBackground\r\nThe \"Campeonato de la República\" (or Copa General Pedro Ramírez)) had been the first Argentine cup contested by clubs playing not only in Primera División but in regional leagues as well, with a total of 35 teams in the first edition. The cup was held from 1943 to 1945.\r\n\r\nA new international competition, \"Copa Ganadores de Copa (also known as \"Recopa Sudamericana\"), organised by CONMEBOL in 1970 as a South American counterpart of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, served as inspiration to the Argentine Association to create a new competition, with the winner team being eligible to play the 1970 edition of Copa Ganadores de Copa.\r\n\r\nFirst edition: 1969\r\nMain article: 1969 Copa Argentina\r\nThe competition was contested by 32 teams using a two-legged elimination format. Two points were awarded for winning a leg, one for a draw and null for a loss. The teams having more points would qualify to the next round. If both teams had same number of points, it would be determined by the total number of goals, total number of goals conceded, and penalty shootout accordingly.\r\n\r\nAll teams in the Primera División Argentina participated the competition with some top teams from the regional leagues, except teams that had already qualified to the Copa Libertadores, namely, Vélez Sársfield and River Plate, the winners and runners-up of 1968 Nacional respectively, and Estudiantes de La Plata, the champions of 1968 Copa Libertadores.\r\n\r\nBoca Juniors and Atlanta entered the final. Boca won the tournament by defeating Atlanta 3–2 on aggregate after two matches were played.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Boca later won the 1969 Nacional and qualified to the 1970 Copa Libertadores, Atlanta qualified to the 1970 \"Copa Ganadores de Copa\" as the runner-up.\r\n\r\nSecond edition: 1970\r\nMain article: 1970 Copa Argentina\r\nApart from teams that had got the Copa Libertadores eligibility, namely Boca Juniors and River Plate, the champions and runners-up of Nacional 1969, and Estudiantes de La Plata, who won the Copa Libertadores 1969, all clubs in the Primera División Argentina participated this competition. The champions of Primera B, Ferro, also took part in the tournament, along with 13 top clubs from regional leagues.\r\n\r\nCopa Argentina 1970 never finished. 32 teams played the competition and San Lorenzo and Vélez Sársfield entered the final. The tournament had been lasting for a long period in that year. Starting in March 1970, the first leg of the final was played in March 1971. At that time, the Copa Ganadores de Copa, which the winner of Copa Argentina would be qualifying for, had already started. Moreover, as Huracán Buceo and Deportes Concepción, the two other team in the same group with the Argentine representative in the Copa Ganadores de Copa, had not confirmed their participation, so the organizer announced the Copa Ganadores de Copa would become a friendly tournament. Therefore, after the first leg of the Copa Argentina final was held, which the teams drew 2-2, the second leg was never played. No Argentine teams participated in the Copa Ganadores de Copa 1971.\r\n\r\nRelaunch\r\nMain article: 2011-12 Copa Argentina\r\nThe reschedule of the Copa Argentina –officialized in 2011– included 186 teams of 7 divisions of the Argentine football league system in a knock-out system competition. All the matches were disputed in neutral locations. The teams of the first division were included in rounds of 32. The champion of the tournament qualified for the next edition of Copa Sudamericana.\r\n\r\nFor the relaunching of the tournament, a new trophy was designed. The cup, made of aluminium, was manufactured at the Norberto Ambrosetti factory of Lobos, Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nThe 2012 final between Boca and Racing was scheduled many times due to fixture congestion. The match was finally played on August 8, 2012, at the Estadio del Bicentenario in San Juan. Boca Juniors won its second trophy after defeating Racing Club by 2-1.\r\n\r\nThe 2012–13 Copa Argentina was scheduled to begin October 23, 2012 in a new two-phase knock-out competition. Arsenal defeated San Lorenzo and won its first trophy of this competition.",

At the top of the Australian league system, it is the country's primary competition for the sport. The A-League was established in 2004 as a successor to the National Soccer League (NSL) and competition commenced in August 2005. The league is currently contested by ten teams; nine based in Australia and one based in New Zealand. It is known as the Hyundai A-League (HAL) through a sponsorship arrangement with the Hyundai Motor Company.\r\n\r\nSeasons run from October to May and include a 27-round regular season and an end-of-season finals series playoff tournament involving the highest-placed teams, culminating in a grand final match. The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed 'premier' and the winner of the grand final is 'champion'. This differs from the other major football codes in Australia, where 'premier' refers to the winner of the grand final and the winner of the regular season is the 'minor premier'. The A-League's non-standard terminology is reflective of the increased prestige associated with winning the regular season in association football compared to other football codes in Australia. Successful A-League clubs gain qualification into the continental competition, the Asian Football Confederation Champions League (ACL).\r\n\r\nSince the league's inaugural season, a total of six clubs have been crowned A-League Premiers and five clubs have been crowned A-League Champions. The current premiers and champions are Brisbane Roar, who won both titles in 2013–14.",

Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Belgian First Division B. Seasons run from late July to early May, with teams playing 30 matches each in the regular season, and then entering play-offs I or play-offs II according to their position in the regular season. Play-offs I (also known as the title playoffs) are contested by the top-six clubs in the regular season, with each club playing each other twice. Play-offs II (also known as the Europa League playoff) are contested by teams ranked 7 to 16 in the regular season, divided in four groups of four teams playing each other twice (six teams from the Belgian First Division B also take part in playoff II). The team finishing in 16th place is relegated.\r\n\r\nThe competition was created in 1895 by the Royal Belgian Football Association and was first won by FC Liégeois. Of the 74 clubs to have competed in the first division since its creation, 16 have been crowned champions of Belgium.

The teams that had been relegated from the Série B in the previous year were joined by teams qualified for each federation state. Qualification rules varied, some federations used the state tournaments as qualification tournaments, others organized exclusive qualification tournaments to the Série C.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2009, the Série C was reduced from 64 teams to 20 and the new Campeonato Brasileiro Série D is the qualifier for Brazilian league football. In its current format the 20 teams are divided into two groups and each team plays all opponents from its own group on a home and away basis.

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Copa do Brasil (English: Brazil Cup) is a knockout football competition played by 91 teams, representing all 26 Brazilian states plus the Federal District. It is the Brazilian domestic cup and the Brazilian equivalent of the FA Cup, Taça de Portugal, Copa del Rey, Coupe de France, Coppa Italia, DFB-Pokal, KNVB Cup, U.S. Open Cup, and Copa Argentina, among others. The Copa do Brasil is an opportunity for teams from smaller states to play against the big teams. \"Giant-killing\" by these smaller clubs has regularly occurred throughout the competition's history. The winner of the cup automatically qualifies for the following edition of the Copa Libertadores de América, the prestigious continental football tournament contested by top clubs in South America organized by COMNEBOL.\r\n\r\nInitially the Copa do Brasil was contested by 32 clubs. The field increased to 40 in 1996, increased to 69 by the year of 2000, and stabilized at 64 after 2001 which it remained at until 2012. Clubs from all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District participate.\r\n\r\nFrom 2001 to 2012, the Copa do Brasil was played in the first half of the year and in those seasons, due to busy scheduling, teams playing in the Copa Libertadores did not participate in the Copa do Brasil in the same year. Thus, the Copa do Brasil champion never defended their title in the next edition, since they would be qualified for the Copa Libertadores that year.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2013, 86 teams participate in the cup and the teams that compete in the Copa Libertadores join the Copa do Brasil directly in the Round of 16. Also, the best 8 teams from the previous year's Campeonato Brasileiro Série A eliminated up to the third round qualify for Copa Sudamericana. From 2017 onward the cup has been contested by 91 teams.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2016, the tournament has been sponsored by Continental AG and is thus currently known as the Copa Continental Pneus do Brasil (English: Continental Tires Brazil Cup) for sponsorship reasons.\r\n\r\nCruzeiro is the most successful club, having won the competition six times, followed by Gremio with 5 titles, then Corinthians, Palmeiras, and Flamengo with 3. Another 11 clubs have won one edition of the competition, resulting in a total of 16 champions. The state with the highest number of titles is São Paulo , with 9. Only two states have champions from more than one city: São Paulo (Jundiaí, Santo André, Santos and São Paulo) and Rio Grande do Sul (Caxias do Sul and Porto Alegre). Rio de Janeiro is the only city with more than two champion clubs (Flamengo, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama).",

It is the oldest international continental football competition. The competition determines the continental champion of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to participate.\r\n\r\nSince 1993, the tournament has generally featured 12 teams – all 10 CONMEBOL teams and two additional teams from other confederations. Mexico has participated in every tournament since 1993, with one additional team drawn from CONCACAF, except for 1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the 12-team roster. The 2016 version of the event, Copa América Centenario, featured sixteen teams, with six teams from CONCACAF in addition to the 10 from CONMEBOL. Mexico's two runner-up finishes are the highest for a non-CONMEBOL side.\r\n\r\nEight of the ten CONMEBOL national teams have won the tournament at least once in its 45 stagings since the event's inauguration in 1916, with only Ecuador and Venezuela yet to win. Uruguay has the most championships in the tournament's history, with 15 cups, while the current champion, Chile, has two cups. Argentina, which hosted the inaugural edition in 1916, has hosted the tournament the most times (nine). The United States is the only non-CONMEBOL country to host, having hosted the event in 2016. On three occasions (in 1975, 1979, and 1983), the tournament was held in multiple South American countries.\r\n\r\nThe highest finishing member of CONMEBOL has the right to participate in the next edition of the FIFA Confederations Cup, but is not obliged to do so.",

Desde el año 2006 está compuesta por veinte equipos, y se disputa entre los meses de mayo a diciembre.\r\n\r\nDesde 2003, se disputa en formato de ida y vuelta, de forma que cada equipo juega dos partidos contra cada uno de los otros, uno como local y otro como visitante. El equipo con más puntos al final del campeonato es declarado campeón. Por lo tanto, no hay un partido final, lo cual ha sido objeto de controversias, ya que tradicionalmente la definición se realizaba con formato de postemporada.\r\n\r\nCada equipo juega treinta y ocho partidos. Al campeón y a los tres equipos siguientes se les otorga plaza en la Copa Libertadores de América, mientras que los equipos que finalizan entre el quinto y el duodécimo puesto tienen asegurado el pasaje a la Copa Sudamericana.

El Campeonato Brasileño se inició en 1959, pero el moderno campeonato fue apoyado por el régimen militar de la época, y facilitado por los avances en la aviación civil y transporte aéreo. Antes de la creación de una liga nacional, los torneos de fútbol más prestigiosos en Brasil eran las ligas estatales, en particular el Campeonato Paulista y el Campeonato Carioca (los torneos estatales de São Paulo y Río de Janeiro, respectivamente).\r\n\r\nEl Campeonato Brasileño es la segunda liga más fuerte del mundo según el ranking oficial de la Federación Internacional de Historia y Estadística de Fútbol (IFFHS).1\r\n\r\nLos clubes brasileños también compiten en otros torneos nacionales de menor importancia, como la Copa de Brasil, así como también en otros de nivel nacional , regional y estatal.\r\n\r\nEl sistema de ligas, encabezado por la Serie A, fue creado en 1959 como la Taça Brasil y con el nombre de Campeonato Brasileño solo en 1971. En Brasil también recibe el nombre de Brasileirão.\r\n\r\nCabe destacar que por decisión de la Confederación Brasileña de Fútbol, todos los títulos oficiales son vigentes desde 1959.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Canadian Premier League (CPL or CanPL; French: Première ligue canadienne) is a professional soccer league in Canada. At the top of the Canadian soccer league system, it is the country's primary national soccer league competition. The league consists of eight teams, from five of Canada's ten provinces. The regular league season lasts from April to October, with each team playing 28 games. The season culminates in the CPL Finals. The CPL champion earns a berth in the CONCACAF League, playing against teams from Central America and the Caribbean. All CPL teams also play in the Canadian Championship against Canadian clubs from other leagues. Qualification for the CONCACAF Champions League is available to CPL clubs through either the Canadian Championship or CONCACAF League.\r\n\r\nThe league was officially sanctioned by the Canadian Soccer Association on May 6, 2017, originally with a soft launch date of 2018, that was later pushed back to 2019. The league's focus is to improve national soccer talent and the sport in Canada, with several rules in place to ensure this. These include a minimum quota of Canadian players on team rosters and starting line-ups, requirements for domestic under-21 players, and a university draft.\r\n\r\nThe league's first season included seven teams, while an eighth, Atlético Ottawa, joined for the second season in 2020. The CPL is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, with plans for a second office in Hamilton, Ontario.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The 2nd Division is the third tier Danish football league, just after the 1st Division. It was founded in 1945, after World War II, as the second-best Danish football division. When the Danish Superliga was founded in 1991, the 2nd Division became the third level league. From 1991 to 1997 the league was played as half-year seasons, as the lower league played spring-autumn tournaments, and the higher leagues played autumn-spring.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe third tier of Danish football has undergone many changes as a buffer zone between the elite classes and amateur clubs. The division, that we today know as the Danish 2nd Division was back in days called the 3rd Division. It started already back in 1936 when III Series was created with two geographically divided constituencies, which included four teams each. Out of the eight teams, there was one who gained promotion to Serie II.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1945–46, the third Division with 10 teams was grounded. One team gained promotion to 2nd Division, and one relegated to the Denmark Series. A change was made in 1951. The 3rd Division was expanded to 12 teams and to teams was relegated to a newly created Qualification Series – the new buffer between the Denmark Series and local leagues.\r\n\r\nThe structure was changed again in 1966. Two geographical circles with 12 teams each were created. Only one team could be promoted and two teams be relegated. When we reached the 1975’s, the number of teams in the league got expanded and the 3rd Division rolled into one row with 16 teams, where two teams could be promoted to the 2nd Division and teams relegated to the Denmark Series.\r\n\r\nFrom 3rd Division to 2nd Division\r\nThe Danish Superliga got a new name in 1991, and at the same time, was the second best division at the time, renamed to 1st Division instead of 2nd Division. The same story happened with the 3rd Division, that changed the name to the 2nd Division – as we know it today. The new 2nd Division consisted now of a West and an East pool.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the 2nd Division changes back to the old structure with a Qualification Series, but only three years later, they changed it back to have a West and East pool.\r\n\r\nFrom 2005, the 2nd Division was changed to have 14 teams each in the East and West pools, with three teams to promote. In addition, was there allowed access to have up to eight reserve teams of the Danish Superliga clubs, in the 2nd Division. The number of teams in the 2nd Division was increased to 16 teams in 2008. But in 2010 they removed the access to have reserve teams in the 2nd Division since they had grounded a Reserve League. This led to a real extension of the 2nd Division, leaving the 2nd Division back with only 8 teams in 2010.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Division did change again in 2015, that reduced the number of teams in the 2nd Division from 32 to 24. 3 pools with each 8 teams was created, where the four top finishers in each pool would be playing for promotion to the 1st Division, with promotion for the two best-placed teams. Also, there would be a relegation pool for the 12 teams that end up as 5–8 in one of their 3 pools, where the 9–12th places relegated to the Denmark Series.",

It is the highest association football league in Denmark and is currently contested by 12 teams each year, with 2 teams to be relegated, which proves to be one of the highest chances of relegation in Europe. Superliga has experienced a great development in the past 5 years, with new stadiums and greater attendances, and the league rank has shifted from twenty-third to twelfth in the country ranking system of UEFA. FC Copenhagen's recent strong performances in Europe are the main reason for the sudden rise of the Danish Superliga, but teams like Odense BK, AaB and Brøndby IF contributed as well.\r\n\r\nThe Superliga is generally perceived as being able to attract players of a slightly higher level than that of the rest of the Scandinavian leagues, partly favoured by a lucrative tax-scheme. Two of the best players in the league in the season of 2010 were former Manchester United player Eric Djemba-Djemba, who now plays at Partizan Belgrade and former Panathinaikos-player Dame N'Doye for FC Copenhagen. For the 2009–10 season, the average attendance per game was 8,315.

It was previously known as the Football League Second Division and prior to the advent of the Premier League, the Football League Third Division.\r\n\r\nAt present (2014–15 season), Oldham Athletic hold the longest tenure in League One, last being out of the division in the 1996–97 season when they were relegated from the Championship. There are currently six former Premier League clubs competing in the League One, namely Barnsley, Bradford City, Coventry City, Oldham Athletic, Sheffield United and Swindon Town.\r\nThere are 24 clubs in Football League One. Each club plays every other club twice (once at home and once away). Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss. At the end of the season a table of the final League standings is determined, based on the following criteria in this order: points obtained, goal difference, goals scored, an aggregate of the results between two or more clubs (ranked using the previous three criteria) and, finally, a series of one or more play-off matches.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each season the top two clubs, together with the winner of the play-offs between the clubs which finished in 3rd–6th position, are promoted to Football League Championship and are replaced by the three clubs that finished at the bottom of that division.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the four clubs that finished at the bottom of Football League One are relegated to Football League Two and are replaced by the top three clubs and the club that won the 4th–7th place play-offs in that division.\r\nSky Sports currently show live League One matches with highlights shown on BBC One on their programme called The Football League Show, which also broadcasts highlights of Football League Championship and Football League Two matches. The show is available on the red button the following Sunday until midday and is available on iPlayer all the following week. Highlights of all games in the Football League are also available to view separately on the Sky Sports website. In Sweden, TV4 Sport has the rights of broadcasting from the league.
